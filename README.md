# mocha-celestia
A collection of my Celestia mods

## Installation
1. Put this folder in your extras folder. The resulting folder structure should look something like celestia/extras/mocha-celestia
2. (OPTIONAL) If you care about the KSP textures, you will need to manually download the maps from the wiki - they are far too large to include in this repo. There are 15 in all - choose whichever you need.

And that's it! You're done!
